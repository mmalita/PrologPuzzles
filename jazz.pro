Saturdays and Sundays are the days that Sheila, Ramon and Niko shop together for music. The CD's they purchase are either rock or jazz. When they visit the music store, each person will purchase one and only one CD. Here are the rules that givern their selections: 
	1. Either Sheila or Ramon will pick rock, but not both of them.
	2. If Sheila picks rock, Niko picks jazz.
	3. Niko and Ramon do not both pick jazz.
	Which one of the three purchased a jazz CD on Saturday and a Rock CD on Sunday.

S1= sheila buys on Saturday  S2= sheila buys on Sunday
R1= ramon buys on Saturday  R2= ramon buys on Sunday
N1= niko buys on Saturday  N2= niko buys on Sunday
